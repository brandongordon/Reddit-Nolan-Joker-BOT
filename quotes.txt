If you’re good at something, never do it for free.
Nobody panics when things go “according to plan”. Even if the plan is horrifying!
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
What doesn't kill you, simply makes you... stranger!

Tell your men they work for me now, this is my city!
Ya wanna know how I got these scars?

*Hi*.
See I'm a man of simple taste. I like things such as gunpowder...dynamite, and...gasoline!

I just want my phone call.
I mean, what happened? Your balls drop off?
Let's not... *blow*... this out of proportion.

Good evening ladies and gentlemen!
Uh... half.
Well *hello* beautiful!
It's not about money- It's about sending a *message*.
No I'm noT.
You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with; nothing to do with all your stregnth.
Very poor choice of words...
Why should I have all the fun?
You let five people die...
Ah you made it, I'm so thrilled!
This town deserves a better class of criminal. And I’m gonna give it to them.
